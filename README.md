# GAN_with_PSO_integration

# Image Enhancement using GAN with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
This project applies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for enhancing the quality of images, using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to tune key hyperparameters. The model is trained and tested on the Adobe FiveK dataset.

## Dataset
We use the *Adobe FiveK* dataset, which contains 5,000 images taken with DSLR cameras and enhanced by five professional photographers.

## Installation
This project was developed and run on [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/). No manual installation is required if you open and run itÂ directlyÂ there.


## Technologies
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
OpenCV for image handling
Matplotlib forÂ visualization

## Usage
ðŸ“Œ Run on Kaggle (Recommended)
Upload this code in kaggleÂ environment. 

Add dataset :- ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/weipengzhang/adobe-fivek](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/weipengzhang/adobe-fivek))
Click "Copy and Edit" (top right) to run it in your own workspace.

The notebook is structured step-by-step:

1. It loads the Adobe FiveK dataset

2. Builds and trains a GAN model

3. Uses PSO to optimize hyperparameters

4. Displays enhanced image results

5. Simply run all cells fromÂ topÂ toÂ bottom.



Thanks to the creators of the Adobe FiveK dataset for providing high-quality training images.
Inspired by research in image enhancement and optimization techniquesÂ usingÂ GANs.
